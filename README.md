## 🧠 Overview

This project demonstrates **Image Captioning** — an AI technique that automatically generates descriptive sentences for images.  
It uses a **Vision Transformer (ViT)** as the image encoder and **GPT-2** as the text decoder, built using the pretrained model  
`nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning` from Hugging Face.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- 🧩 Generates meaningful, human-like captions for any image  
- ⚡ Powered by **ViT-GPT2**, a state-of-the-art pretrained model  
- 💻 Supports **GPU (CUDA)** for faster inference  
- 📷 Works with all major image formats  
- 🔁 Reusable function `predict_step()` for easy integration  

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:
- Learn how **AI connects vision and language**  
- Understand the use of **Transformers** in real-world applications  
- Practice **loading and using pretrained models** from Hugging Face  
- Strengthen your **Python and deep learning fundamentals**
